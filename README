AI::Evolve::Befunge
=====================================

This is an evolutionary algorithm module written in Perl.  It produces small
programs in a language named Befunge, which have been determined to fit a
specified set of criteria.

It is designed to provide a practical means of evolving useful AI programs.
It takes a while to run but has verifiable results.

Please see the POD documentation included in the AI::Evolve::Befunge module
itself, for the details.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   sudo ./Build install

You can copy the config file, example.conf, to /etc/ai-evolve-befunge.conf and
edit it to your heart's content.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

perl 5.10.0
Algorithm::Evolutionary::Wheel
aliased
Class::Accessor::Fast
Language::Befunge >= 4.10
Language::Befunge::Storage::Generic::Vec::XS >= 0.02
Language::Befunge::Vector::XS >= 1.1.0
LWP::UserAgent
Parallel::Iterator
Perl6::Export::Attrs
Task::Weaken
Test::Exception
Test::MockRandom
Test::Output
UNIVERSAL::require
YAML

In addition to the above, the test suite can optionally use Test::Pod and
Devel::Leak.  Without each of these, it will skip a portion of the tests.
Note: the Devel::Leak tests result in a lot of ugly hexspam, so it probably
isn't worth the trouble.  The Pod test is nice though.
